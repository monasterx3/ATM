# ATM
This is an Automatic Teller Machine Java GUI Program.
The gui was created on Eclispe Photon using the window builder plugin. 
We used an Arraylist Data Structure to store the various information needed for the database.

Project Structure:
1. AtmGui.java is the GUI intializer that will take you to the Atmframee screen
2. AtmFramee.java will prompt you to the main screen where the user can either enter account number or create a new account
3. PinM.java will prompt you to pin screen where the user will enter there pin number 
4. NextFrame.java is the main ATM screen where the user can decide whether to deposit, withdraw, or check their balance
5. Deposit.java, WithdrawalWindow.java, and CheckBalance.java are the various options the user can go through.
